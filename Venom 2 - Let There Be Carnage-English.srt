1
00:01:25,736 --> 00:01:27,571
Lights out!

2
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:31,208
Cletus, are you there?

3
00:01:31,342 --> 00:01:33,644
My angel.

4
00:01:34,545 --> 00:01:36,680
This is for you.

5
00:01:41,352 --> 00:01:43,521
What did the doctor say?

6
00:01:43,654 --> 00:01:46,457
He said the mutations are advancing.

7
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,526
My powers are too strong.

8
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:50,528
Cletus, I'm scared.

9
00:01:50,661 --> 00:01:52,330
It's gonna be okay.

10
00:01:52,463 --> 00:01:54,632
They're coming to take me away.

11
00:01:55,933 --> 00:01:58,168
They're sending me to a place

12
00:01:58,302 --> 00:02:00,237
where there are others like me.

13
00:02:00,371 --> 00:02:02,072
They can't do that.

14
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,909
They can't take you from me.

15
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:08,045
You're my one bright light.

16
00:02:08,178 --> 00:02:11,148
I will always love you!

17
00:02:11,281 --> 00:02:12,281
Frances!

18
00:02:13,551 --> 00:02:15,553
Get off!

19
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,892
Frances!

20
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:27,465
No! No!

21
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:44,382
Any last words?

22
00:03:20,551 --> 00:03:23,621
Welcome to your new home, Frances.

23
00:04:40,598 --> 00:04:43,066
Your old boyfriend's finally getting

24
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,135
what he deserves.

25
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:51,942
And the world will be a safer place without him.

26
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,511
Detective mulligan, with all due respect,

27
00:05:27,645 --> 00:05:29,813
I don't want anything to do with cletus kasady.

28
00:05:29,947 --> 00:05:32,816
Well, that's too bad, because he only wants to see you.

29
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,352
Though, in my opinion, you had your chance with kasady

30
00:05:35,485 --> 00:05:36,987
and you blew it.

31
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,323
Right, um, so... What does he want?

32
00:05:40,457 --> 00:05:42,192
Maybe he wants to spill the beans

33
00:05:42,325 --> 00:05:44,361
about where the missing bodies are buried.

34
00:05:44,494 --> 00:05:48,298
So you're gonna have to do the right thing for a change.

35
00:05:53,571 --> 00:05:54,738
No!

36
00:05:54,872 --> 00:05:57,841
Take your tiny hands off of me!

37
00:05:57,975 --> 00:06:02,245
We should be out there protecting the city lethally!

38
00:06:07,217 --> 00:06:09,086
What was that?

39
00:06:09,219 --> 00:06:10,387
Unhand me!

40
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,423
Man should never consent to crawl

41
00:06:13,557 --> 00:06:16,159
when he has the impulse to fly.

42
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:19,730
You are a bottom-feeder.

43
00:06:19,863 --> 00:06:21,665
Be quiet.

44
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,935
How many times have I told you

45
00:06:25,068 --> 00:06:29,272
that I want you to hide yourself when I am working?

46
00:06:29,406 --> 00:06:30,841
I am serious. It is important.

47
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,610
You have to show me respect.

48
00:06:32,743 --> 00:06:34,511
Respect? Respect? Yes. Yes.

49
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:35,846
Okay. Okay.

50
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,715
Kasady gonna give you the scoop, right?

51
00:06:37,848 --> 00:06:39,349
Right. Wrong.

52
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:42,119
What do you mean? Because you blow everything.

53
00:06:42,252 --> 00:06:43,120
Oh, okay, I see.

54
00:06:43,253 --> 00:06:44,722
You're talking about Anne again.

55
00:06:44,855 --> 00:06:46,757
I miss her!

56
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:50,628
I will do it.

57
00:06:50,761 --> 00:06:51,962
I don't like you.

58
00:06:52,095 --> 00:06:53,496
Let me eat him!

59
00:06:53,631 --> 00:06:58,035
You do not deserve nice things.

60
00:07:08,812 --> 00:07:12,082
Welcome back, Eddie Brock.

61
00:07:13,483 --> 00:07:16,086
I've been thinking about you.

62
00:07:18,455 --> 00:07:19,790
What do you want, cletus?

63
00:07:19,923 --> 00:07:22,425
I mean, why am I here?

64
00:07:22,559 --> 00:07:28,799
Do a man who's buried alive a kindness, won't you?

65
00:07:28,932 --> 00:07:32,502
Get a message out to all my...

66
00:07:32,636 --> 00:07:33,771
Fans.

67
00:07:35,005 --> 00:07:38,909
And in return, I'll give you my life.

68
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:40,042
What?

69
00:07:40,077 --> 00:07:41,211
Story.

70
00:07:41,344 --> 00:07:43,714
I heard the written word

71
00:07:43,847 --> 00:07:46,583
hasn't been working out so well.

72
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:50,754
Piece like this, an exclusive...

73
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:54,024
Would put you back on top.

74
00:07:56,093 --> 00:07:57,194
Go on.

75
00:07:57,327 --> 00:07:59,863
People love...

76
00:07:59,997 --> 00:08:01,865
Serial killers.

77
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:09,172
All my secrets laid bare, Eddie.

78
00:08:09,306 --> 00:08:12,676
So much carnage.

79
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:14,911
But why me?

80
00:08:15,012 --> 00:08:18,181
I like you.

81
00:08:19,049 --> 00:08:20,183
All right, it's a deal.

82
00:08:20,317 --> 00:08:22,452
What's your message?

83
00:08:25,355 --> 00:08:29,326
That distant cathedral

84
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:31,895
is all I see... mm-hmm.

85
00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:36,466
Fractured angel

86
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,069
the other part of me.

87
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:43,073
Print that in your column.

88
00:08:44,174 --> 00:08:46,009
Is that it? This, um... Who's gonna...

89
00:08:46,143 --> 00:08:49,813
Who's gonna read that, some random haiku?

90
00:08:50,513 --> 00:08:52,682
Print it,

91
00:08:52,816 --> 00:08:56,353
and what's mine is yours.

92
00:08:56,486 --> 00:08:58,588
Wow, lucky me.

93
00:08:58,722 --> 00:09:00,457
Goodbye, Eddie.

94
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:04,427
Thank you.

95
00:09:04,561 --> 00:09:06,696
What a dick.

96
00:09:07,597 --> 00:09:10,200
Eddie, look. Look.

97
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:11,802
What are you doing?

98
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:14,271
Your job for you.

99
00:09:21,378 --> 00:09:23,246
Eddie.

100
00:09:25,749 --> 00:09:28,752
Don't forget me, Eddie.

101
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:38,295
What did you get?

102
00:09:38,428 --> 00:09:41,431
Uh, I got a headache and probably got tuberculosis.

103
00:09:41,564 --> 00:09:43,100
What? A little louder.

104
00:09:43,233 --> 00:09:45,735
He read me poetry, man.

105
00:09:45,869 --> 00:09:47,113
Is this some kind of joke to you, Eddie?

106
00:09:47,137 --> 00:09:48,571
Because I'm not laughing.

107
00:09:48,705 --> 00:09:50,841
Yeah, you could do with a laugh.

108
00:09:50,974 --> 00:09:52,409
Come on, man.

109
00:09:52,542 --> 00:09:54,487
These things, they just take a little time, all right?

110
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:56,313
Well, the second he gives you something...

111
00:09:56,446 --> 00:09:57,446
Of course.

112
00:09:57,547 --> 00:09:59,049
Keep me ahead of the curve, Eddie.

113
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:00,617
Don't embarrass me. All right.

114
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:01,852
Do you understand?

115
00:10:01,985 --> 00:10:03,854
Trust me, the only scoop

116
00:10:03,987 --> 00:10:06,256
I'm getting today is double chocolate chip.

117
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:08,691
No! I get brain freeze.

118
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:15,232
Come here.

119
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:16,599
Look.

120
00:10:16,733 --> 00:10:18,435
I'm looking. Grab those.

121
00:10:20,603 --> 00:10:22,339
All right.

122
00:10:24,942 --> 00:10:26,877
Whoa. Okay.

123
00:10:29,179 --> 00:10:31,915
Now, what do you think?

124
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:34,885
I think I'm Pablo Picasso. No!

125
00:10:36,987 --> 00:10:39,222
Okay. Come here. Look.

126
00:10:42,792 --> 00:10:45,362
Well, say what you see. Uh, it's a house.

127
00:10:45,495 --> 00:10:46,496
Never mind.

128
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,138
Oh, I know this one.

129
00:10:55,272 --> 00:10:57,207
It's a tree. Idiot.

130
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,076
Sit down.

131
00:11:00,043 --> 00:11:03,013
Now, pay attention.

132
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:27,670
Bingo.

133
00:11:27,804 --> 00:11:30,373
Holy cow.

134
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,348
Would you say your friendship with cletus kasady

135
00:11:38,481 --> 00:11:41,084
is what allowed you to solve this decades-old mystery?

136
00:11:41,218 --> 00:11:42,996
You are the only person from the outside world

137
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,054
he's spoken with.

138
00:11:44,187 --> 00:11:45,422
Seems he likes you.

139
00:11:45,555 --> 00:11:47,224
Well, you know, he's a serial killer.

140
00:11:47,357 --> 00:11:49,126
I don't see how he can like anyone.

141
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:50,961
Brock was able to uncover

142
00:11:51,094 --> 00:11:53,263
what the FBI and police could not.

143
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:56,633
Bowing to public outrage,

144
00:11:56,766 --> 00:11:59,536
the governor of California has overturned his moratorium

145
00:11:59,669 --> 00:12:02,039
and reinstated the death penalty for kasady.

146
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:10,981
Brock's career has been given a much-needed revival,

147
00:12:11,114 --> 00:12:13,216
putting him back on top once more.

148
00:12:29,032 --> 00:12:31,701
A harrowing story finally comes to an end.

149
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,972
Vindication for the victims and closure for the families.

150
00:12:35,105 --> 00:12:37,374
Thanks to the diligence of one man.

151
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:39,909
Thank you, Eddie Brock. And venom.

152
00:12:40,043 --> 00:12:43,380
You know, this could be us, Eddie.

153
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:48,085
Going out there, solving cases, fighting bad guys.

154
00:12:48,218 --> 00:12:50,020
Maybe I eat them, hmm?

155
00:12:50,153 --> 00:12:52,222
And then we save the day.

156
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,724
But we saved the day. It's done.

157
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:59,296
You said I could eat bad guys!

158
00:12:59,429 --> 00:13:01,164
This again?

159
00:13:01,298 --> 00:13:03,433
I need to be free,

160
00:13:03,566 --> 00:13:07,637
feeling the wind in my hair and the sand between my toes.

161
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:08,905
You don't have any hair.

162
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:10,673
You are not listening to me.

163
00:13:10,807 --> 00:13:12,375
Oh, I'm listening.

164
00:13:12,509 --> 00:13:15,212
I cannot live like this anymore.

165
00:13:15,345 --> 00:13:18,048
I'm starving. So eat those guys.

166
00:13:18,181 --> 00:13:19,816
I can't.

167
00:13:19,949 --> 00:13:21,684
Sonny and Cher are best friends.

168
00:13:21,818 --> 00:13:24,521
Are you serious? That's ridiculous. That's what...

169
00:13:27,824 --> 00:13:30,627
Man, that was abusive.

170
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,295
That was abuse.

171
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,832
And that's a $2,000 TV.

172
00:13:35,965 --> 00:13:38,301
You have got to get control of your aggression.

173
00:13:38,435 --> 00:13:39,902
That is why we have snookie!

174
00:13:40,037 --> 00:13:42,472
I cannot live on chicken and chocolate alone.

175
00:13:42,605 --> 00:13:43,806
I need brains.

176
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,208
Chickens have brains.

177
00:13:45,342 --> 00:13:47,477
I most passionately disagree.

178
00:13:48,645 --> 00:13:49,912
Look.

179
00:13:50,047 --> 00:13:51,848
Look at those poor idiots.

180
00:13:53,616 --> 00:13:54,851
Small brains.

181
00:13:54,984 --> 00:13:57,120
Come on, man, it's not their fault that you, uh...

182
00:13:57,254 --> 00:13:59,122
You live on the old phenylethyla...

183
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:00,599
Laphenylethylan. Phenylethylalanine.

184
00:14:00,623 --> 00:14:01,991
Yeah, I just... I just said that.

185
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:03,460
I've told you a thousand times,

186
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:05,262
because it is only found... Yeah?

187
00:14:05,395 --> 00:14:07,564
In brains and in chocolate. And in chocolate.

188
00:14:07,697 --> 00:14:09,599
That's right. All right, well, how about this?

189
00:14:09,732 --> 00:14:13,203
You live in my body, you live by my rules.

190
00:14:13,336 --> 00:14:15,238
I live in your body because... Why?

191
00:14:15,372 --> 00:14:18,375
Unfortunately, I don't have many options.

192
00:14:18,508 --> 00:14:20,477
Well, how about this, son?

193
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,545
The FBI is still investigating us

194
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:25,282
for all of that stuff that "we were involved with,"

195
00:14:25,415 --> 00:14:27,584
so if one more head goes missing,

196
00:14:27,717 --> 00:14:31,020
we will get hauled off into area 51.

197
00:14:31,154 --> 00:14:32,355
They will kill us both.

198
00:14:32,489 --> 00:14:35,292
So somebody has to be responsible.

199
00:14:35,425 --> 00:14:39,762
Responsibility... It's for the mediocre.

200
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:44,401
Food! Can you stop doing that?

201
00:14:44,534 --> 00:14:47,104
Food! Food! Please just stop doing that now.

202
00:14:47,237 --> 00:14:48,477
Come on, stop doing that. Food!

203
00:14:48,538 --> 00:14:50,015
I have a deadline! Will you... Food...!

204
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:51,874
Goddamn it! Fine!

205
00:14:58,248 --> 00:15:00,250
Good evening, Eddie. Hey, Mrs. Chen.

206
00:15:00,383 --> 00:15:01,984
Good evening, venom.

207
00:15:02,119 --> 00:15:03,420
He says hi. Oh.

208
00:15:03,553 --> 00:15:04,954
Chocolate hasn't arrived yet.

209
00:15:05,088 --> 00:15:07,724
No! Oh, no. We have a deal.

210
00:15:07,857 --> 00:15:10,560
What's gonna happen? You gonna stop protecting me?

211
00:15:10,693 --> 00:15:12,061
I don't think so.

212
00:15:12,195 --> 00:15:13,596
I've been keeping my mouth shut,

213
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,732
feeding your little secret. Wow.

214
00:15:15,865 --> 00:15:18,868
Little old Mrs. Chen is a little old blackmailer, huh?

215
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,371
Less of the old. I am 39.

216
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:23,740
And I am Barry manilow. Right.

217
00:15:23,873 --> 00:15:25,642
I am happy to eat Mrs. Chen.

218
00:15:25,775 --> 00:15:28,445
No, no, you cannot eat Mrs. Chen.

219
00:15:28,578 --> 00:15:32,649
What? Well, I guess it's gonna have to be plan b.

220
00:15:34,717 --> 00:15:36,386
What's plan b?

221
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,821
Aah! Not this again!

222
00:15:38,955 --> 00:15:41,724
I need human brains to survive.

223
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:44,161
Uh-uh. Now, pick up some chickens, man.

224
00:15:44,294 --> 00:15:45,795
Let's go.

225
00:15:59,476 --> 00:16:02,379
I'm done with this grossness.

226
00:16:06,449 --> 00:16:09,619
Look at all the amazing things that we can do.

227
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:15,392
We are wasting our talent.

228
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,435
Bad guy.

229
00:16:28,871 --> 00:16:31,808
Hello, kitty.

230
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:35,312
Leave him. Leave him be.

231
00:16:35,445 --> 00:16:37,747
Leave him be! Leave him be!

232
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,917
I shall remove your head. No, you won't.

233
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:43,320
I will use it for bowling! No, you will not.

234
00:16:43,453 --> 00:16:45,188
I will take it to...

235
00:16:45,322 --> 00:16:46,989
What is the one that we like, Eddie?

236
00:16:47,123 --> 00:16:48,425
It's lucky strike.

237
00:16:48,558 --> 00:16:50,560
Yes! Lucky strike! Put him down!

238
00:16:50,693 --> 00:16:52,429
I will take you to lucky strike,

239
00:16:52,562 --> 00:16:54,831
and I will score a 300-point game.

240
00:16:54,964 --> 00:16:56,766
You won't. The rest of your pudgy little

241
00:16:56,899 --> 00:16:59,436
boy body will be left here...

242
00:16:59,569 --> 00:17:01,871
Rolling around in dumpster juice.

243
00:17:02,004 --> 00:17:03,740
Oh, god.

244
00:17:03,873 --> 00:17:06,676
No! Put him down! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

245
00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:08,778
no, no, no, no, no, no!

246
00:17:08,911 --> 00:17:10,713
No!

247
00:17:10,847 --> 00:17:12,482
Fine!

248
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,918
She didn't want our help.

249
00:17:16,052 --> 00:17:19,121
She did not know she needed our help, Eddie.

250
00:17:19,256 --> 00:17:20,823
There is a difference.

251
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:26,929
It is Anne.

252
00:17:27,063 --> 00:17:30,633
Anne is on the phone, Eddie!

253
00:17:33,002 --> 00:17:34,371
Hey, Anne.

254
00:17:34,504 --> 00:17:35,872
Hey, e-Eddie. Hi.

255
00:17:36,005 --> 00:17:37,374
Hi. Be nice to her.

256
00:17:37,507 --> 00:17:38,775
You sound out of breath.

257
00:17:38,908 --> 00:17:41,444
I'm-I'm not catching you at a bad time, am I?

258
00:17:41,578 --> 00:17:44,046
No, no, not at all. I'm just, uh...

259
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,249
I'm just hanging around. Okay.

260
00:17:46,383 --> 00:17:49,218
Uh, I'm-I'm sorry I haven't returned your calls.

261
00:17:49,352 --> 00:17:50,853
I guess...

262
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:53,890
I just needed a little space after the whole...

263
00:17:54,023 --> 00:17:56,459
Alien biting a guy's head off thing, so...

264
00:17:56,593 --> 00:17:58,194
Ah, the good old days.

265
00:17:58,328 --> 00:18:00,196
Anyway, so I have some news,

266
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,998
and-and I was wondering if we could meet.

267
00:18:02,131 --> 00:18:04,467
Yes! Yeah, sure, that would be, uh...

268
00:18:04,601 --> 00:18:06,803
That would be fine. Great.

269
00:18:06,936 --> 00:18:09,138
Okay, great. Uh, how's tomorrow night?

270
00:18:09,272 --> 00:18:11,374
Tomorrow night? Yeah, great.

271
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:13,510
8:00? L'araignée?

272
00:18:13,643 --> 00:18:14,953
Okay, great. Looking forward to it.

273
00:18:14,977 --> 00:18:16,546
Oh... yeah, okay. Me, too. Bye.

274
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:17,680
Great.

275
00:18:17,814 --> 00:18:18,881
It's over with the doctor!

276
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:20,216
That is the voice of a woman

277
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,419
who just got brutally dumped.

278
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,654
♪ All right ♪

279
00:18:27,089 --> 00:18:29,025
♪ yeah... ♪

280
00:18:29,792 --> 00:18:30,960
Stop.

281
00:18:31,093 --> 00:18:32,995
Don't you want to look your best?

282
00:18:33,129 --> 00:18:36,198
Just leave me alone. You are always nitpicking.

283
00:18:42,004 --> 00:18:43,139
Wow.

284
00:18:44,974 --> 00:18:46,509
Hey.

285
00:18:46,643 --> 00:18:48,778
Okay. Hi. Yeah.

286
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:51,881
Wow.

287
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,586
Awkward.

288
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,588
So, uh, h-how's it going? How's, uh...

289
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:00,723
How's Mr. Belvedere? Yeah. Uh, good, good.

290
00:19:00,857 --> 00:19:02,801
You know, he's still wiping his ass on the carpet.

291
00:19:02,825 --> 00:19:04,494
He learned that from you.

292
00:19:04,627 --> 00:19:07,063
Yeah, how-how's, uh... How's the legal aid work going?

293
00:19:07,196 --> 00:19:09,332
Well, you know how much I love an underdog, so...

294
00:19:09,466 --> 00:19:11,300
Yeah. Yeah, that's why you...

295
00:19:11,434 --> 00:19:13,302
Put up with me for so long, huh?

296
00:19:13,436 --> 00:19:14,604
You said it.

297
00:19:16,038 --> 00:19:18,007
S-So... so...

298
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,976
So?

299
00:19:20,109 --> 00:19:22,311
I don't know, I-I thought it would be better

300
00:19:22,445 --> 00:19:24,313
to tell you in person that...

301
00:19:24,447 --> 00:19:26,583
Uh-huh.

302
00:19:28,017 --> 00:19:30,086
No!

303
00:19:30,219 --> 00:19:31,554
Wow. Oh, Anne.

304
00:19:31,688 --> 00:19:32,889
Wow, that is, uh...

305
00:19:33,022 --> 00:19:35,425
That is so much bigger than the...

306
00:19:35,558 --> 00:19:37,059
The one that I got you.

307
00:19:37,193 --> 00:19:38,495
Ugh, it's gaudy.

308
00:19:38,628 --> 00:19:40,497
That's Dan, right? Doc-doctor Dan.

309
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:42,098
Yeah, that... it's Dan.

310
00:19:42,231 --> 00:19:44,033
Holy shit, Anne. Way to go.

311
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:45,166
Are you okay?

312
00:19:45,201 --> 00:19:46,403
Yeah, I'm okay.

313
00:19:46,536 --> 00:19:48,671
Well, I am not okay. Yeah.

314
00:19:48,805 --> 00:19:50,245
You could just say, "congratulations.

315
00:19:50,339 --> 00:19:51,641
I'm happy for you."

316
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:53,142
You know, like two people

317
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,077
who still care enough about each other to lie

318
00:19:55,211 --> 00:19:57,122
so that the other one doesn't feel like complete shit. I...

319
00:19:57,146 --> 00:19:58,748
Maybe we could do that version of this?

320
00:19:58,881 --> 00:20:01,217
No, I am... I am happy for you, Anne.

321
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,852
You know, I'm, uh... no.

322
00:20:02,985 --> 00:20:04,120
Congratulations.

323
00:20:04,253 --> 00:20:05,488
Thank you.

324
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:08,090
That was going to be us, Eddie.

325
00:20:08,224 --> 00:20:10,593
I, for one, would not be inconsolable

326
00:20:10,727 --> 00:20:12,361
if Dan were to fall into traffic

327
00:20:12,495 --> 00:20:14,163
and lose his head and his feet

328
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,232
and all of his teeth! What?

329
00:20:16,365 --> 00:20:17,366
What was that?

330
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,002
What? Nothing.

331
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:21,471
Whoa.

332
00:20:21,604 --> 00:20:23,540
If I ask you a question,

333
00:20:23,673 --> 00:20:26,042
do you have the ability to tell me the truth?

334
00:20:26,175 --> 00:20:27,577
You mean as in being

335
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,646
super happy for you because of your engagement?

336
00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:31,380
Because, I mean, you just told me to lie,

337
00:20:31,514 --> 00:20:33,382
so that's really, really confusing.

338
00:20:33,516 --> 00:20:34,851
Is venom with you?

339
00:20:35,585 --> 00:20:36,919
He's dead.

340
00:20:37,053 --> 00:20:38,921
I am. I'm playing dead right now.

341
00:20:39,055 --> 00:20:40,423
Yeah, I mean, he...

342
00:20:41,357 --> 00:20:43,092
Right.

343
00:20:43,225 --> 00:20:44,494
Okay. Okay.

344
00:20:44,627 --> 00:20:47,497
Well, that's...

345
00:20:48,465 --> 00:20:49,932
You just don't change, do you?

346
00:20:50,066 --> 00:20:51,677
What are you talking about? This is just a...

347
00:20:51,701 --> 00:20:53,636
It's a huge shock. Um, I'm in...

348
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:56,138
Anne, I'm in love with you. This is a lot to process.

349
00:20:56,272 --> 00:20:58,407
No, the truth is you don't love anybody. You can't.

350
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:00,443
Commitment's just not your thing.

351
00:21:00,577 --> 00:21:03,112
All right, then, fine.

352
00:21:03,245 --> 00:21:05,281
Do not marry Dan.

353
00:21:05,414 --> 00:21:07,850
Dan makes me feel safe. Ugh.

354
00:21:07,984 --> 00:21:10,753
Okay, and you made me feel like I was on a roller coaster.

355
00:21:10,887 --> 00:21:13,422
And sometimes you just have to know when to get off.

356
00:21:13,556 --> 00:21:15,124
Yeah, and not yak. And not yak!

357
00:21:15,257 --> 00:21:16,759
You know, not yak.

358
00:21:16,893 --> 00:21:18,528
Yak.

359
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:23,332
Hey, venom.

360
00:21:23,466 --> 00:21:26,435
Take care of him, all right?

361
00:21:26,569 --> 00:21:28,337
Don't let him keep messing everything up.

362
00:21:28,471 --> 00:21:31,474
I'm going to make you cry now, Eddie.

363
00:21:31,608 --> 00:21:33,275
She will love it.

364
00:21:33,409 --> 00:21:36,278
Cry. Cry.

365
00:21:36,412 --> 00:21:38,180
It's a lot to process.

366
00:21:39,816 --> 00:21:41,584
Congratulations, Anne.

367
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:43,853
It's great news.

368
00:21:55,031 --> 00:21:56,298
Slow down, pal.

369
00:21:56,432 --> 00:21:57,567
Why?

370
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,736
You don't believe in consequences.

371
00:21:59,869 --> 00:22:02,338
No injuries. You fix them.

372
00:22:02,471 --> 00:22:04,473
No hangovers. You mend them.

373
00:22:04,607 --> 00:22:06,643
I couldn't even hurt myself if I tried.

374
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:19,121
Eddie, I apologize that I can't mend the heart.

375
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:22,592
Emotional pain, it hits much harder,

376
00:22:22,725 --> 00:22:24,894
and it lasts longer.

377
00:22:25,027 --> 00:22:30,232
You just need to pull up your big-boy pants and take it.

378
00:22:30,366 --> 00:22:32,869
Yeah, well, that's easy for you to say.

379
00:22:33,002 --> 00:22:35,071
Why?

380
00:22:35,204 --> 00:22:37,439
Because I'm a real boy

381
00:22:37,574 --> 00:22:40,109
and you're just an amoeba.

382
00:22:40,242 --> 00:22:41,944
I will only take that

383
00:22:42,078 --> 00:22:44,647
because we are hurting right now.

384
00:22:49,418 --> 00:22:52,655
Don't worry, buddy. I will get you through this.

385
00:22:59,896 --> 00:23:02,098
Do you know what always cheers me up

386
00:23:02,231 --> 00:23:04,033
in the morning, Eddie?

387
00:23:04,166 --> 00:23:06,869

405
00:23:52,481 --> 00:23:55,484
Whoa, listen to this.

406
00:23:55,618 --> 00:23:58,387
"Dearest pally pal,

407
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:02,024
"I hereby invite you to witness

408
00:24:02,158 --> 00:24:05,294
"my demise,

409
00:24:05,427 --> 00:24:08,030
"my final moments

410
00:24:08,164 --> 00:24:12,735
"on this spinning shit wheel

411
00:24:12,869 --> 00:24:15,905
that we call earth."

412
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:18,440
You are responsible

413
00:24:18,574 --> 00:24:22,478
for bringing about the end of cletus kasady.

414
00:24:22,611 --> 00:24:27,616
It's only right that you hold the door for me on my way out.

415
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:30,052
They'll stop my heart...

416
00:24:30,186 --> 00:24:32,121
Just like it stopped at my birth.

417
00:24:33,089 --> 00:24:35,024
What if cletus kasady

418
00:24:35,157 --> 00:24:37,293
had never been revived?

419
00:24:37,426 --> 00:24:39,829
He would never have pushed grandma

420
00:24:39,962 --> 00:24:42,999
down a flight of stairs.

421
00:24:43,132 --> 00:24:47,436
Bye-bye, grandma, you puckered old sphincter.

422
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:50,239
He would never have thrown a hair dryer

423
00:24:50,372 --> 00:24:51,974
into mother's bathtub.

424
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:56,846
Yes, mama, I'm a bad, bad boy.

425
00:24:56,979 --> 00:24:59,081
He would never have been beaten

426
00:24:59,215 --> 00:25:01,818
to the brink of death by daddy-o

427
00:25:01,951 --> 00:25:04,586
and sent to...

428
00:25:04,721 --> 00:25:08,524
St. estes home for unwanted children.

429
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:16,866
That circus of hell...

430
00:25:22,238 --> 00:25:25,674
With one bright light.

431
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:30,179
Oh, Eddie,

432
00:25:30,312 --> 00:25:35,551
we are all born into this world through blood and pain.

433
00:25:35,684 --> 00:25:39,321
Every hero has an origin story.

434
00:25:43,826 --> 00:25:45,361
Your friend...

435
00:25:45,494 --> 00:25:47,363
"Cletus kasady."

436
00:25:47,496 --> 00:25:50,399
Kiss, hug, kiss, hug.

437
00:25:51,801 --> 00:25:53,402
Smiley face.

438
00:25:54,771 --> 00:25:55,838
Ew.

439
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:57,139
Nutjob.

440
00:25:57,273 --> 00:25:58,875
You know, I-I should be there.

441
00:25:59,008 --> 00:26:00,509
Uh, no, it's a bad idea.

442
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,011
I mean, I-I-I put him there.

443
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:03,579
Actually, he put himself there

444
00:26:03,712 --> 00:26:06,282
when he decided to be a complete lunatic.

445
00:26:06,415 --> 00:26:07,683
Ta-da!

446
00:26:07,817 --> 00:26:10,186
You know, it would be nice just to have your support

447
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:12,221
just... I mean, just for once.

448
00:26:12,354 --> 00:26:15,157
Catsup? You know what I mean?

449
00:26:15,291 --> 00:26:17,493
This place is an all-you-can-eat buffet.

450
00:26:17,626 --> 00:26:18,995
Who's going to care

451
00:26:19,128 --> 00:26:20,797
if I Polish off a couple of these idiots?

452
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:23,050
You can't be sure who is and who is not guilty, buddy.

453
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:24,801
They're in prison! Yeah, but, you know,

454
00:26:24,934 --> 00:26:26,294
some people take false confessions.

455
00:26:26,368 --> 00:26:27,848
They, uh... you know, they take pleas.

456
00:26:27,904 --> 00:26:29,205
We watched making a murderer.

457
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:30,172
You all right?

458
00:26:30,306 --> 00:26:31,874
Yeah, man, I'm just practicing.

459
00:26:32,008 --> 00:26:33,742
I am a predator, Eddie.

460
00:26:33,876 --> 00:26:35,945
Mm-hmm. Lions do not eat salad.

461
00:26:36,078 --> 00:26:37,518
Yeah, but you're not a lion, are you?

462
00:26:37,613 --> 00:26:39,581
I mean, I see you more of a vexatious little

463
00:26:39,715 --> 00:26:41,650
pig, dog, house bat thing.

464
00:26:41,784 --> 00:26:42,819
That's fine.

465
00:26:42,952 --> 00:26:44,753
You suck. You suck!

466
00:26:44,887 --> 00:26:46,622
Excuse me? Yeah, wow.

467
00:26:46,755 --> 00:26:48,290
I don't have an explanation for that.

468
00:26:48,424 --> 00:26:51,660
I think I just... I'm having a panic attack, um...

469
00:26:51,794 --> 00:26:53,429
Yeah, I'll sign here.

470
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:56,432
Stand two feet away from the bars.

471
00:26:56,565 --> 00:26:58,500
No touching the condemned.

472
00:26:58,634 --> 00:27:00,536
Understood.

473
00:27:00,669 --> 00:27:03,672
Visitor's here.

474
00:27:11,013 --> 00:27:12,982
This is a "me" thing, not a "we" thing.

475
00:27:13,115 --> 00:27:14,917
Everything is a "you" thing.

476
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:18,587
Oh, happy day for you, Eddie Brock.

477
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,490
Mm, what a scoop.

478
00:27:21,623 --> 00:27:24,193
The end of the magical...

479
00:27:24,326 --> 00:27:25,995
Misery tour.

480
00:27:26,128 --> 00:27:28,965
I worry for your soul.

481
00:27:29,098 --> 00:27:30,666
How will you live with the weight

482
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,534
of snuffing out a man's life?

483
00:27:32,668 --> 00:27:34,370
I was, uh... I was hoping

484
00:27:34,503 --> 00:27:36,705
maybe you could give me a couple pointers.

485
00:27:40,009 --> 00:27:41,878
Funny little guy, aren't you?

486
00:27:42,011 --> 00:27:43,679
Don't need that.

487
00:27:43,812 --> 00:27:45,948
My memory is outstanding.

488
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:49,351
Rude.

489
00:27:49,485 --> 00:27:51,921
Consequences.

490
00:27:52,054 --> 00:27:55,691
Every decision you ever make.

491
00:27:55,824 --> 00:27:59,161
Who do we leave behind,

492
00:27:59,295 --> 00:28:01,130
and how do we leave them?

493
00:28:02,831 --> 00:28:06,702
A connubial bed, empty,

494
00:28:06,835 --> 00:28:09,705
waiting in the darkness

495
00:28:09,838 --> 00:28:12,841
for the rescuer who never comes.

496
00:28:12,975 --> 00:28:14,143
Because of you.

497
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:15,844
This guy makes zero sense.

498
00:28:15,978 --> 00:28:19,882
You and I are the same.

499
00:28:20,016 --> 00:28:22,151
No. No, we're not.

500
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:25,454
Twisted insides, mean daddies.

501
00:28:25,587 --> 00:28:28,557
You feel like home to me, Eddie, like family.

502
00:28:29,591 --> 00:28:30,792
And really, truly,

503
00:28:30,927 --> 00:28:33,629
that is all I ever wanted in this world.

504
00:28:33,762 --> 00:28:35,064
Family.

505
00:28:35,197 --> 00:28:37,266
Well, killing your grandmother and your mother

506
00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:39,268
sure is a funny way of showing it.

507
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:46,142
Anything you want to unburden yourself with before...

508
00:28:47,509 --> 00:28:51,047
Um, this happens?

509
00:28:51,948 --> 00:28:53,182
Yes.

510
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:58,120
I have wishes to bestow upon you.

511
00:28:58,254 --> 00:28:59,721
Oh, that is kind.

512
00:28:59,855 --> 00:29:03,725
I want to wish you...

513
00:29:03,859 --> 00:29:05,727
This heartbreak.

514
00:29:05,861 --> 00:29:07,463
Uh-oh. Too late.

515
00:29:07,596 --> 00:29:11,500
I wish for you to see out your days alone,

516
00:29:11,633 --> 00:29:13,502
as you always have been.

517
00:29:13,635 --> 00:29:14,803
Watch it, pal.

518
00:29:14,937 --> 00:29:16,505
Wh-where are you going with this?

519
00:29:16,638 --> 00:29:18,607
You are a cancer

520
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:22,344
to everyone who ever loved you, Eddie.

521
00:29:22,478 --> 00:29:26,015
Deceived your trusting fiancée.

522
00:29:26,148 --> 00:29:30,319
And no wonder daddy could never look at you again

523
00:29:30,452 --> 00:29:33,189
after you killed his wife, your mother,

524
00:29:33,322 --> 00:29:35,124
just by being born.

525
00:29:35,257 --> 00:29:37,059
You son of a bitch!

526
00:29:37,193 --> 00:29:38,894
No, no! No, no, no, don't! Don't!

527
00:29:39,028 --> 00:29:41,497
Speak to my friend again like that... I dare you!

528
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:46,035
Hey, hey!

529
00:29:46,902 --> 00:29:47,769
No touching the inmate.

530
00:29:47,903 --> 00:29:49,371
Hey, back up!

531
00:29:53,942 --> 00:29:55,111
Eddie?

532
00:29:55,244 --> 00:29:56,812
You're done.

533
00:29:56,945 --> 00:30:02,284
I have tasted blood before, my friend, and that is not it.

534
00:30:02,418 --> 00:30:06,088
Eddie Brock has a big secret.

535
00:30:06,222 --> 00:30:08,057
Shut up, kasady!

536
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:19,568
That may have been a mistake.

537
00:30:19,701 --> 00:30:21,603
Shut up.

538
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:23,672
Hey, aren't you Eddie Brock?

539
00:30:23,805 --> 00:30:25,741
I don't know anymore.

540
00:30:27,809 --> 00:30:29,445
Eddie!

541
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:31,323
I don't want to hear another word out your mouth.

542
00:30:31,347 --> 00:30:32,981
Eddie. I don't want to hear it.

543
00:30:33,115 --> 00:30:34,783
Eddie, I am sorry.

544
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:37,419
That was his last time on record ever.

545
00:30:37,553 --> 00:30:40,022
There's no more... Any words for his victims or...

546
00:30:40,156 --> 00:30:41,557
You know, they're gone.

547
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:44,093
Any clues of outstanding bodies,

548
00:30:44,226 --> 00:30:45,927
we-we've lost forever and completely.

549
00:30:46,062 --> 00:30:47,363
I didn't mean to.

550
00:30:47,496 --> 00:30:49,096
You didn't mean to? And I said I'm sorry.

551
00:30:49,198 --> 00:30:50,558
You didn't mean to, but you did it.

552
00:30:50,632 --> 00:30:52,177
I mean, you just decided... I don't know.

553
00:30:52,201 --> 00:30:53,335
That's it, you did it.

554
00:30:53,469 --> 00:30:54,836
You know, you didn't even think

555
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:56,748
that we might get caught, we might get killed?

556
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:58,516
No, you don't think about things like that, do you?

557
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,285
You just think about chickens, you think about you,

558
00:31:00,309 --> 00:31:02,478
you think about what you want, and you think about you.

559
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:04,380
Let me remind you of something, Eddie.

560
00:31:04,513 --> 00:31:06,248
You were a loser before I came along.

561
00:31:06,382 --> 00:31:08,317
You were nothing. I made you special.

562
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:09,718
Oh, you made me special, huh?

563
00:31:09,851 --> 00:31:11,363
Well, let me tell you something, right?

564
00:31:11,387 --> 00:31:12,788
Before you came along, I had a life.

565
00:31:12,921 --> 00:31:14,499
I didn't have chickens, all right? But I had dreams.

566
00:31:14,523 --> 00:31:15,867
Yeah, I had dreams, and I had a fiancée,

567
00:31:15,891 --> 00:31:17,593
and I had a really successful TV show!

568
00:31:17,726 --> 00:31:20,662
Ah, but you destroyed all of those things by yourself.

569
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,699
Yeah, but you know what? I rebuilt my life,

570
00:31:23,832 --> 00:31:25,567
and now I just want to live it. Good night.

571
00:31:25,701 --> 00:31:27,103
And how did you build this new life?

572
00:31:27,236 --> 00:31:28,437
Hmm? Excuse me?

573
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:30,406
Well, who found the clue on the wall

574
00:31:30,539 --> 00:31:32,941
so you could be this big, shiny hero?

575
00:31:33,075 --> 00:31:34,643
Hmm? Who found the clue?

576
00:31:34,776 --> 00:31:36,478
Who? Wow.

577
00:31:36,612 --> 00:31:37,679
Yeah.

578
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:39,148
No, no, no.

579
00:31:39,281 --> 00:31:42,651
This is not about being a hero for me, man.

580
00:31:42,784 --> 00:31:46,355
This is about wanting to live in peace.

581
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:49,658
D-Do you understand what I'm talking about?

582
00:31:49,791 --> 00:31:51,127
No, you don't.

583
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,604
You don't understand what I'm talking about.

584
00:31:52,628 --> 00:31:54,130
Okay, this is about me wanting to live

585
00:31:54,263 --> 00:31:56,465
without you whining in my ear all the time

586
00:31:56,598 --> 00:32:00,336
about eating bad guys or, like, nagging me about Anne

587
00:32:00,469 --> 00:32:02,604
or destroying my place or destroying my life!

588
00:32:02,738 --> 00:32:06,675
Do you know how lucky you are that I chose you?

589
00:32:06,808 --> 00:32:08,277
You chose me?

590
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:10,279
Buddy, I'm the only person that took you in

591
00:32:10,412 --> 00:32:12,390
when your friends kicked you off the planet ming mong

592
00:32:12,414 --> 00:32:13,782
'cause you are a reject!

593
00:32:13,915 --> 00:32:16,352
You are a pariah. Lethal protection, my ass.

594
00:32:16,485 --> 00:32:18,354
You couldn't protect anything. You are useless.

595
00:32:18,487 --> 00:32:21,123
You couldn't get a job down here cleaning toilets!

596
00:32:21,257 --> 00:32:23,159
I'm sorry.

597
00:32:23,292 --> 00:32:24,502
I don't know what came over me.

598
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:25,827
Please, let me fix it.

599
00:32:25,961 --> 00:32:27,329
So I can break it again!

600
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,871
You son of a bitch.

601
00:32:43,379 --> 00:32:44,713
Out!

602
00:32:44,846 --> 00:32:45,914
Get out.

603
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:47,349
Take your stuff. Get out!

604
00:32:47,483 --> 00:32:49,851
This is my house.

605
00:32:49,985 --> 00:32:52,053
No!

606
00:32:52,188 --> 00:32:53,589
Keep it down up there!

607
00:32:56,425 --> 00:32:57,826
Get out!

608
00:33:07,336 --> 00:33:09,405
Sonny?

609
00:33:09,538 --> 00:33:11,173
You wouldn't dare!

610
00:33:11,307 --> 00:33:13,475
Yeah, absolutely.

611
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:17,513
No, no, no!

612
00:33:17,646 --> 00:33:19,215
Yeah! No!

613
00:33:19,348 --> 00:33:20,849
I'm calling the police!

614
00:33:20,982 --> 00:33:22,751
I-I am so sorry.

615
00:33:25,421 --> 00:33:27,456
Show yourself.

616
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,770
You can't win! Take a look at me.

617
00:33:41,903 --> 00:33:43,739
Look at the size of you.

618
00:33:43,872 --> 00:33:45,574
Puny.

619
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:50,379
How dare you?

620
00:33:55,851 --> 00:33:57,253
I guess this is goodbye.

621
00:33:57,386 --> 00:34:00,456
Oh, yeah. Finally something we agree on.

622
00:34:05,394 --> 00:34:07,296
What in the world?

623
00:34:07,429 --> 00:34:09,064
All this crazy shit.

624
00:34:09,197 --> 00:34:10,799
Yeah.

625
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:24,746
Hmm?

626
00:34:27,182 --> 00:34:29,217
No. No.

627
00:34:29,351 --> 00:34:31,487
No, no, no, no.

628
00:34:33,355 --> 00:34:35,056
No!

629
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:37,158
Yeah!

630
00:34:37,293 --> 00:34:39,160
No!

631
00:34:39,295 --> 00:34:41,463
Yeah! No!

632
00:34:42,364 --> 00:34:44,232
Oh, yeah.

633
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,167
No.

634
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,908
No, no, no.

635
00:34:53,041 --> 00:34:54,776
I wish I never met you!

636
00:34:56,077 --> 00:34:57,946
Sayonara!

637
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:13,028
Cletus kasady, you have been tried, convicted

638
00:35:13,161 --> 00:35:16,632
and sentenced to death by the state of California.

639
00:35:18,099 --> 00:35:22,338
May your passing bring closure to the victims' families,

640
00:35:22,471 --> 00:35:26,241
and may you find peace in the hereafter.

641
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:29,044
Soon come chaos.

642
00:35:29,177 --> 00:35:31,880
Chaos soon come.

643
00:35:32,814 --> 00:35:34,650
Are those your final words?

644
00:35:36,985 --> 00:35:38,554
Enjoy the show.

645
00:36:16,558 --> 00:36:19,094
Warden.

646
00:36:19,227 --> 00:36:21,497
Something wicked...

647
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:23,999
This way comes.

648
00:36:33,575 --> 00:36:36,545
Somebody let me out!

649
00:37:50,385 --> 00:37:52,020
Don't move!

650
00:38:02,731 --> 00:38:04,365
Hey!

651
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,549
Please.

652
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,885
I got a family.

653
00:38:48,176 --> 00:38:50,378
Any last words, warden?

654
00:38:50,512 --> 00:38:52,247
Don't! Please!

655
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:12,100
♪ San Quentin, may you rot and burn in hell ♪

656
00:39:12,233 --> 00:39:16,071

659
00:39:51,339 --> 00:39:53,274
You two are being evicted.

660
00:40:03,018 --> 00:40:04,686
Come on, don't look at me like that.

661
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,487
It was never, never gonna work out.

662
00:40:06,622 --> 00:40:08,023
All right?

663
00:40:17,966 --> 00:40:19,534
Yes.

664
00:40:19,668 --> 00:40:21,436
Just because of how quickly he moved in...

665
00:40:21,569 --> 00:40:23,080
The offensive line cannot pick him up.

666
00:40:23,104 --> 00:40:24,773
Breaking news.

667
00:40:24,906 --> 00:40:26,975
Serial killer cletus kasady is on the run...

668
00:40:27,108 --> 00:40:28,309
Shit.

669
00:40:28,443 --> 00:40:29,921
As a statewide manhunt is underway...

670
00:40:29,945 --> 00:40:31,713
Oh, shit. After last night's audacious

671
00:40:31,847 --> 00:40:33,281
escape from San Quentin prison.

672
00:40:39,755 --> 00:40:42,023
It is absolutely chaos here.

673
00:40:42,157 --> 00:40:45,493
We have reports of multiple casualties.

674
00:40:45,627 --> 00:40:47,929
We don't how cletus kasady...

675
00:40:48,063 --> 00:40:49,497
Hey. What, you're not dead?

676
00:40:49,631 --> 00:40:50,799
No.

677
00:40:50,932 --> 00:40:52,701
Can I come in? Yeah, sure.

678
00:40:52,834 --> 00:40:54,235
Come on in.

679
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:57,973
Uh, yeah, I was just seeing for myself on the news.

680
00:40:58,106 --> 00:41:01,176
Yeah, on a scale of one to ten, it's 11 bad.

681
00:41:01,309 --> 00:41:03,444
Reports coming from San Quentin are,

682
00:41:03,578 --> 00:41:05,580
quite frankly, bananas. Nice TV.

683
00:41:05,714 --> 00:41:07,749
W-Well, how-how did he do it?

684
00:41:07,883 --> 00:41:09,317
Yeah, how did he, indeed? Yeah.

685
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:11,086
That's the million-dollar question.

686
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:13,588
And yet again, you were his special visitor.

687
00:41:13,722 --> 00:41:15,423
So, what did he tell you?

688
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:17,458
Me? Nothing. Nothing at all.

689
00:41:17,592 --> 00:41:19,260
Nothing about an escape plan?

690
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:22,063
Nothing about some kind of elaborate breakout costume?

691
00:41:22,197 --> 00:41:23,498
No.

692
00:41:23,631 --> 00:41:24,933
Well, how come, every time,

693
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:27,068
you seem to be at the center of these things

694
00:41:27,202 --> 00:41:29,637
and then miraculously you know nothing about it?

695
00:41:29,771 --> 00:41:32,340
Maybe I'm lucky.

696
00:41:32,473 --> 00:41:34,676
Yeah, right.

697
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:38,279
You-you said, um...

698
00:41:39,447 --> 00:41:40,481
The reports coming out

699
00:41:40,615 --> 00:41:42,517
of San Quentin are bananas?

700
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:44,450
What-what do... What do you mean by "bananas"?

701
00:41:44,552 --> 00:41:46,097
Remember when I asked you a similar question...

702
00:41:46,121 --> 00:41:48,890
Uh-huh... the day you interviewed him?

703
00:41:49,024 --> 00:41:50,959
Information is currency.

704
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:53,594
You of all people should know that.

705
00:41:53,729 --> 00:41:55,864
Come on.

706
00:41:58,499 --> 00:42:00,435
I thought he'd come to try to find the man

707
00:42:00,568 --> 00:42:04,605
that nearly got him executed, but I guess not.

708
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:06,474
I'd lay low if I was you.

709
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:09,310
I'll see myself out.

710
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:19,821
Okay, think.

711
00:42:19,955 --> 00:42:21,656
Think, think, think, think, think.

712
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:23,658
What would venom do?

713
00:42:23,792 --> 00:42:25,326
He would find you before you find me,

714
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,128
and he would eat your face! Damn.

715
00:42:27,262 --> 00:42:29,164
All right.

716
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:31,032
Who do we leave behind,

717
00:42:31,166 --> 00:42:33,001
and how do we leave them?

718
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:35,570
A connubial bed, empty... "Connubial bed."

719
00:42:35,703 --> 00:42:38,173
Left to rot... Is it marriage? What...

720
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:41,109
Waiting in the darkness for the rescuer who never comes.

721
00:42:41,242 --> 00:42:42,677
I don't understand.

722
00:42:42,811 --> 00:42:46,614
"That circle of hell..."

723
00:42:46,748 --> 00:42:48,850
Because of you.

724
00:42:48,984 --> 00:42:52,888
You and I are the same. "With one bright light"?

725
00:42:53,021 --> 00:42:54,990
Twisted insides, mean daddies.

726
00:42:55,123 --> 00:42:56,357
"Bright light."

727
00:42:56,491 --> 00:42:59,694
You feel like home to me.

728
00:42:59,828 --> 00:43:02,463
Like family. St. estes.

729
00:43:21,182 --> 00:43:22,984
Crapola!

730
00:43:23,118 --> 00:43:25,787
Another one bites the dust.

731
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,471
Look at all these weirdos.

732
00:43:43,604 --> 00:43:45,473
My kind of people.

733
00:43:46,774 --> 00:43:49,277
Nice costume. Hey!

734
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:51,046
Awesome work.

735
00:43:51,179 --> 00:43:53,481
Greatest costume ever. Oh, my god.

736
00:43:53,614 --> 00:43:56,451
Oh. Is that Japanese?

737
00:43:56,584 --> 00:43:58,386
No, I made it myself.

738
00:43:58,519 --> 00:44:00,521
Hey. Who, me?

739
00:44:00,655 --> 00:44:02,523
Hello, gorgeous.

740
00:44:02,657 --> 00:44:04,525
Sorry, no, you're not my type.

741
00:44:04,659 --> 00:44:08,463
I am out of the Eddie closet.

742
00:44:33,654 --> 00:44:36,691
Hello, darlin'.

743
00:44:36,824 --> 00:44:38,693
Ooh, racer red.

744
00:44:38,826 --> 00:44:40,828
Got to have it.

745
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:48,236
Let's get this party started.

746
00:44:50,638 --> 00:44:52,707
Oh, hell yes.

747
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,375
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

748
00:44:54,509 --> 00:44:56,011
Hey! Stop!

749
00:44:56,144 --> 00:44:57,913
Stop that! Stop! Stop!

750
00:44:58,046 --> 00:44:59,881
Ah, shit.

751
00:45:05,954 --> 00:45:08,089
You are real. I am.

752
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:11,626
And once I kill that thing that made me,

753
00:45:11,759 --> 00:45:14,429
we will be indestructible.

754
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:18,499
I know where to find him, but first,

755
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:22,703
I need you to help me find something I lost.

756
00:45:22,837 --> 00:45:25,473

Thank you, one person.

774
00:46:29,704 --> 00:46:31,672
Eddie was wrong.

775
00:46:33,241 --> 00:46:36,944
He kept me hidden because he was ashamed.

776
00:46:38,913 --> 00:46:40,781
But look at me now.

777
00:46:40,915 --> 00:46:43,784
You love me, and I'm free!

778
00:46:45,853 --> 00:46:48,423
Yeah! Yeah!

779
00:46:49,524 --> 00:46:52,393
Stop this cruel treatment of aliens.

780
00:46:52,527 --> 00:46:54,829
It is wrong.

781
00:46:54,962 --> 00:46:57,165
All of us should be able to live together

782
00:46:57,298 --> 00:46:59,367
upon this ball of rock.

783
00:47:00,801 --> 00:47:02,170
Yeah!

784
00:47:02,303 --> 00:47:05,006
Free to be who we be!

785
00:47:07,542 --> 00:47:08,709

789
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,295
Whoa, that was a hard act to follow.

790
00:47:28,596 --> 00:47:31,832
I wish you could have seen me tonight...

791
00:47:33,901 --> 00:47:35,570
Eddie.

792
00:48:20,315 --> 00:48:22,350
Holy shit.

793
00:48:24,252 --> 00:48:26,421
Mulligan. Uh, it's Eddie Brock here.

794
00:48:26,554 --> 00:48:28,156
Look, uh, this may be a long shot,

795
00:48:28,289 --> 00:48:29,800
but I-I think I may have found something.

796
00:48:29,824 --> 00:48:31,359
Go on, Eddie. What do you got?

797
00:48:31,492 --> 00:48:33,170
Last time I spoke to kasady, he was talking to me

798
00:48:33,194 --> 00:48:35,263
about connubial beds and-and marriage.

799
00:48:35,396 --> 00:48:36,973
And, uh, it didn't make a whole lot of sense to me,

800
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:39,667
but, um, I'm here at St. estes, and I found this, uh...

801
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:42,503
Well, I'm standing in front of a... of a...

802
00:48:42,637 --> 00:48:44,272
Of a tree, and I'm-I'm looking at it.

803
00:48:44,405 --> 00:48:45,845
It's, uh... It's got a carving on it.

804
00:48:45,973 --> 00:48:50,378
It says "ck loves fb."

805
00:48:50,511 --> 00:48:52,547
I'm thinking that maybe whoever this fb is

806
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,182
might know where he's headed.

807
00:48:54,315 --> 00:48:57,652
And, uh... a-and if you can, I don't know,

808
00:48:57,785 --> 00:48:59,420
pull up some files from St. estes,

809
00:48:59,554 --> 00:49:03,291
maybe you can figure out who this fb is.

810
00:49:03,424 --> 00:49:06,026
Fb, that's, uh... That's Frances barrison.

811
00:49:06,161 --> 00:49:08,796
Wow. That-that's quick.

812
00:49:08,929 --> 00:49:10,731
Yeah, it's impossible, Eddie.

813
00:49:10,865 --> 00:49:14,335

Got any of those internets?

and wear it to a party!

No one does.

Well, Frances,

824
00:50:58,839 --> 00:51:01,175
it seems your sweetheart has done a Houdini act

825
00:51:01,309 --> 00:51:03,411
over there at San Quentin.

826
00:51:05,045 --> 00:51:07,047
It's all over the news.

827
00:51:07,181 --> 00:51:09,750
Oh, don't get excited.

828
00:51:09,884 --> 00:51:11,752
He's not gonna find you.

829
00:51:15,656 --> 00:51:17,157
Screw you.

830
00:51:17,292 --> 00:51:19,294
How flattering.

831
00:51:19,427 --> 00:51:20,928
But you're not my type.

832
00:51:21,061 --> 00:51:22,997
I wonder where he could be.

833
00:51:26,233 --> 00:51:28,703
I'm right here.

834
00:51:28,836 --> 00:51:30,671
Ta-da.

835
00:51:52,159 --> 00:51:53,294
Hi, baby.

836
00:51:56,431 --> 00:51:58,299
I...

837
00:51:58,433 --> 00:52:01,302
Don't want you to freak out, okay?

838
00:52:01,436 --> 00:52:04,739
Um, I'd like you to meet...

839
00:52:04,872 --> 00:52:07,007
Carnage.

840
00:52:20,254 --> 00:52:22,222
That is so hot.

841
00:52:39,474 --> 00:52:40,941
Go!

842
00:52:52,453 --> 00:52:54,054
A '66.

843
00:52:54,188 --> 00:52:56,290
My dream car.

844
00:52:56,424 --> 00:52:57,992
Yeah, I remember.

845
00:52:58,125 --> 00:52:59,494
Let's see what you got.

846
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:32,727
Mm, mm.

847
00:53:38,132 --> 00:53:41,101
Yes, baby!

848
00:53:57,351 --> 00:54:00,688
This is sfpd. Stand down.

849
00:54:25,713 --> 00:54:27,314
Stop!

850
00:54:27,448 --> 00:54:28,883
You'll kill him!

851
00:54:29,016 --> 00:54:32,587
She does that again, I'll eat her face.

852
00:54:34,321 --> 00:54:36,423
He's sensitive to sound.

853
00:54:39,126 --> 00:54:42,497
Stop the vehicle. Stand down.

854
00:54:49,103 --> 00:54:52,607
Who said romance was dead?

855
00:54:57,177 --> 00:54:59,647
Hey. No drunks in here.

856
00:55:01,882 --> 00:55:04,952
Help me. Food.

857
00:55:05,085 --> 00:55:06,854
Out. You get out!

858
00:55:06,987 --> 00:55:08,856
Chocolate.

859
00:55:11,492 --> 00:55:12,693
Venom?

860
00:55:12,827 --> 00:55:14,461
I'm having trouble

861
00:55:14,595 --> 00:55:17,231
keeping them standing, Mrs. C.

862
00:55:17,364 --> 00:55:19,233
Where's Eddie?

863
00:55:19,366 --> 00:55:22,036
Food.

864
00:55:30,578 --> 00:55:32,580
Monsters!

865
00:55:32,713 --> 00:55:35,315
Monsters everywhere!

866
00:55:35,449 --> 00:55:37,417
They're everywhere!

867
00:55:37,552 --> 00:55:40,054
Monsters!

868
00:55:57,237 --> 00:55:59,039
Put out an apb.

869
00:55:59,173 --> 00:56:00,675
Form a perimeter.

870
00:56:00,808 --> 00:56:02,610
Blockade state lines.

871
00:56:02,743 --> 00:56:04,812
And bring in Brock.

872
00:56:07,682 --> 00:56:09,516
I'm no use to anybody here.

873
00:56:09,650 --> 00:56:10,851
I'm just wasting your time.

874
00:56:10,985 --> 00:56:12,620
Well, you know what I keep thinking?

875
00:56:12,753 --> 00:56:14,393
I keep thinking, "what else is Eddie Brock

876
00:56:14,488 --> 00:56:15,768
"not sharing about cletus kasady?

877
00:56:15,890 --> 00:56:18,258
"Now, why was it Eddie that cletus wanted

878
00:56:18,392 --> 00:56:20,761
to witness the execution?" Huh?

879
00:56:20,895 --> 00:56:22,930
Bad things happen around you.

880
00:56:23,063 --> 00:56:25,232
Multiple dead bodies at your building last year,

881
00:56:25,365 --> 00:56:28,502
that bizarre outburst at the lobster restaurant,

882
00:56:28,636 --> 00:56:31,205
and only you at the life foundation

883
00:56:31,338 --> 00:56:33,373
when that rocket exploded.

884
00:56:33,507 --> 00:56:35,209
And now Clyde's found Bonnie,

885
00:56:35,342 --> 00:56:37,102
and there's a dead psychiatrist at a facility

886
00:56:37,144 --> 00:56:38,779
I knew nothing about until today.

887
00:56:38,913 --> 00:56:40,948
And people are talking about seeing monsters.

888
00:56:41,081 --> 00:56:43,918
Monsters? Uh, what-what do you mean...

889
00:56:44,051 --> 00:56:45,920
What do you mean, "monsters"? Monsters, Eddie!

890
00:56:46,053 --> 00:56:48,656
Everywhere cletus goes, so goes this supposed monster.

891
00:56:48,789 --> 00:56:51,425
Oh, god. Talk to me, Eddie.

892
00:56:51,558 --> 00:56:53,293
Talk to me!

893
00:56:55,930 --> 00:56:57,264
How's he doing it, Eddie?

894
00:56:58,365 --> 00:57:00,000
What's the secret?

895
00:57:00,134 --> 00:57:02,302
How's he making people see things?

896
00:57:02,436 --> 00:57:03,604
All right, I, uh...

897
00:57:05,105 --> 00:57:06,907
I can't answer any more of your questions

898
00:57:07,041 --> 00:57:09,076
without making my phone call.

899
00:57:13,814 --> 00:57:15,783
I'll get you your phone call.

900
00:57:15,916 --> 00:57:18,185
But you know what secrets want, Eddie?

901
00:57:18,318 --> 00:57:19,754
They want out.

902
00:57:19,887 --> 00:57:21,856
That's why they're so hard to keep.

903
00:57:30,698 --> 00:57:32,700
Eddie asked you to do this?

904
00:57:32,833 --> 00:57:34,277
And he doesn't have anyone else that can help him?

905
00:57:34,301 --> 00:57:35,612
We're gonna be late for the party.

906
00:57:35,636 --> 00:57:36,771
He's in trouble, Dan.

907
00:57:36,904 --> 00:57:38,773
Yeah, trouble is his thing.

908
00:57:39,874 --> 00:57:41,642
Are there gonna be aliens again?

909
00:57:41,776 --> 00:57:43,978
No, of course not.

910
00:57:45,245 --> 00:57:47,114
I'd like to speak to him alone.

911
00:57:47,247 --> 00:57:49,116
Well, your duty of honesty supersedes

912
00:57:49,249 --> 00:57:52,219
your duty to the client if somebody gets harmed.

913
00:57:52,352 --> 00:57:54,922
They teach you that at posh school?

914
00:57:56,190 --> 00:57:57,524
Oh, hey. Anne.

915
00:57:57,658 --> 00:58:00,094
Hey, Anne, thank you so... Thank you so much for coming.

916
00:58:00,227 --> 00:58:03,230
Boy, that little guy's a charmer, huh?

917
00:58:03,363 --> 00:58:05,733
How much do I need to worry about you right now?

918
00:58:05,866 --> 00:58:07,267
Uh, I-I messed up.

919
00:58:07,401 --> 00:58:08,769
Okay. How badly?

920
00:58:08,903 --> 00:58:11,338
Uh, it couldn't be worse, and it's-it's all on me.

921
00:58:11,471 --> 00:58:12,707
Whatever you did, Eddie,

922
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:14,541
you just need to tell the cops the truth.

923
00:58:14,675 --> 00:58:16,310
No. No. No, I can't tell them

924
00:58:16,443 --> 00:58:18,312
that they are chasing a serial killer

925
00:58:18,445 --> 00:58:21,849
who's also got an alien inside of him.

926
00:58:21,982 --> 00:58:24,719
And he's capable of killing everybody.

927
00:58:27,354 --> 00:58:28,522
Venom.

928
00:58:28,655 --> 00:58:30,691
Talk to me. What's happening?

929
00:58:30,825 --> 00:58:33,794
No, he's-he's not here. He's not here.

930
00:58:35,495 --> 00:58:37,765
Is this, like, an "I'm lying" "he's not here,"

931
00:58:37,898 --> 00:58:39,566
or is this a real "he's not here"?

932
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:40,868
He's not here.

933
00:58:41,001 --> 00:58:42,502
Jesus Christ, Eddie.

934
00:58:42,636 --> 00:58:44,504
St. estes fire. All units.

935
00:58:44,638 --> 00:58:45,973
What the actual f...

936
00:58:46,106 --> 00:58:47,884
Eddie, think. Think. I don't know. I don't know.

937
00:58:47,908 --> 00:58:49,519
All I know that... I-Is that he can't go long

938
00:58:49,543 --> 00:58:51,254
without eating food, right, so he's eating chicken

939
00:58:51,278 --> 00:58:52,913
and he eats chocolate, and that's it.

940
00:58:53,047 --> 00:58:56,116
And that is only if he's still observing the rules.

941
00:58:59,553 --> 00:59:00,788
We need to find him.

942
00:59:00,921 --> 00:59:02,990
You mean I need to find him.

943
00:59:03,123 --> 00:59:04,759
Yeah, you need to find him, please.

944
00:59:04,892 --> 00:59:06,593
And then i-i... I will fix it.

945
00:59:06,727 --> 00:59:08,929
I'll try. Thank you.

946
00:59:11,866 --> 00:59:13,067
Mrs. Chen.

947
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,102
Who's asking? It's me.

948
00:59:16,370 --> 00:59:18,038
What do you want?

949
00:59:18,172 --> 00:59:19,940
Oh, she's a charmer. Okay, listen.

950
00:59:20,074 --> 00:59:21,075
You broke Eddie's heart.

951
00:59:21,208 --> 00:59:22,488
Okay, I actually don't have time

952
00:59:22,576 --> 00:59:23,820
to explain why that's wildly off the Mark.

953
00:59:23,844 --> 00:59:24,924
Do you know where venom is?

954
00:59:25,012 --> 00:59:26,513
You want to break his heart, too?

955
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:28,415
I'm not gonna get into who did what to who.

956
00:59:28,548 --> 00:59:30,293
Eddie said that he might be here because of the chocolate.

957
00:59:30,317 --> 00:59:31,952
I-I just need to speak with the alien.

958
00:59:32,086 --> 00:59:33,663
Wha... hey, you said there weren't gonna be any aliens.

959
00:59:33,687 --> 00:59:35,856
I meant more aliens. Breaking news.

960
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:37,267
The mayor has issued a curfew...

961
00:59:37,291 --> 00:59:39,259
Can you turn the volume up, please?

962
00:59:39,393 --> 00:59:41,161
Kasady and barrison should be treated

963
00:59:41,295 --> 00:59:43,831
as armed and extremely dangerous.

964
00:59:43,964 --> 00:59:46,400
An all-out manhunt continues tonight.

965
00:59:46,533 --> 00:59:47,802
So?

966
00:59:47,935 --> 00:59:50,170
Cletus has a symbiote. Oh, my god.

967
00:59:50,304 --> 00:59:52,572
Any other information you're pathologically lying about?

968
00:59:52,706 --> 00:59:54,441
Pussy. Excuse me?

969
00:59:54,574 --> 00:59:55,574
Eddie needs venom.

970
00:59:55,642 --> 00:59:56,722
She just called me a pussy.

971
00:59:56,811 --> 00:59:57,978
He said he didn't need him,

972
00:59:58,112 --> 00:59:59,613
that life was better without him.

973
00:59:59,746 --> 01:00:03,017
Okay, I don't understand. What do you care...

974
01:00:03,150 --> 01:00:05,285
Oh, wait a second.

975
01:00:07,154 --> 01:00:09,223
You get out here right now.

976
01:00:10,925 --> 01:00:13,260
Do you... d-do you see that?

977
01:00:13,393 --> 01:00:16,030
Seriously, do you see that? Yeah, hon, I've seen it.

978
01:00:16,163 --> 01:00:18,132
Eddie's going to have to fight this battle

979
01:00:18,265 --> 01:00:20,267
all by his little bitch self.

980
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,160
Oh, don't be a big baby. Go help your friend.

981
01:00:22,269 --> 01:00:25,072
He said I couldn't get a job fixing toilets.

982
01:00:25,973 --> 01:00:27,041
Cletus will come for him.

983
01:00:27,174 --> 01:00:28,608
He won't survive without you.

984
01:00:28,742 --> 01:00:30,310
Of course he won't.

985
01:00:30,444 --> 01:00:33,780
Because I am the hero of the two of us.

986
01:00:35,983 --> 01:00:38,185
Yeah, you're the big sexy hero.

987
01:00:40,454 --> 01:00:41,922
You're the coolest,

988
01:00:42,056 --> 01:00:44,524
you're the hottest, and you're the bravest.

989
01:00:44,658 --> 01:00:45,893
I am.

990
01:00:46,026 --> 01:00:47,586
You know, I'm still standing right here.

991
01:00:47,694 --> 01:00:49,997
No one likes you, Dan!

992
01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:52,232
I love seeing you in action.

993
01:00:57,071 --> 01:00:59,773
Let's go save that asshole.

994
01:01:05,345 --> 01:01:08,548
I promised we'd be free from here.

995
01:01:08,682 --> 01:01:12,686
And we'd walk to the cathedral on the hill.

996
01:01:14,922 --> 01:01:16,556
A wedding.

997
01:01:16,690 --> 01:01:18,358
Three guests.

998
01:01:18,492 --> 01:01:20,460
One for each of us.

999
01:01:20,594 --> 01:01:23,463
The cop that took my eye.

1000
01:01:23,597 --> 01:01:25,699
Eddie Brock.

1001
01:01:25,832 --> 01:01:28,402
And venom.

1002
01:01:29,703 --> 01:01:32,606
A red wedding.

1003
01:01:35,675 --> 01:01:38,612
You... you didn't find him?

1004
01:01:50,090 --> 01:01:52,292
Oh, my lord.

1005
01:01:52,426 --> 01:01:53,928
What happened?

1006
01:02:04,171 --> 01:02:05,772
Hey, Dan.

1007
01:02:05,906 --> 01:02:07,241
All right, let's go.

1008
01:02:07,374 --> 01:02:09,243
I'm not talking to him!

1009
01:02:09,376 --> 01:02:11,278
Well, he doesn't want to come out.

1010
01:02:11,411 --> 01:02:13,156
What-what do you mean? We-we have to leave right now

1011
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:14,724
'cause cletus is gonna wipe the city out.

1012
01:02:14,748 --> 01:02:16,816
We're not doing shit until he apologizes.

1013
01:02:16,951 --> 01:02:19,462
So, he's looking for an apology. Look, I know that amends aren't

1014
01:02:19,486 --> 01:02:21,021
really your thing, but... An apology?

1015
01:02:21,155 --> 01:02:22,832
What, like, as in right... Right now, an apology?

1016
01:02:22,856 --> 01:02:26,060
I need him to beg.

1017
01:02:26,193 --> 01:02:28,162
Fine, I will be the bigger of us.

1018
01:02:28,295 --> 01:02:31,798
I will always be the bigger of us, but go on.

1019
01:02:31,932 --> 01:02:33,209
What did he say? What is he saying?

1020
01:02:33,233 --> 01:02:34,935
He said he's listening very sincerely.

1021
01:02:35,069 --> 01:02:36,403
All right, listen to this.

1022
01:02:36,536 --> 01:02:37,604
I am sorry.

1023
01:02:37,737 --> 01:02:39,539
Not the right tone.

1024
01:02:39,673 --> 01:02:41,008
I'm sorry.

1025
01:02:41,141 --> 01:02:42,376
Nope.

1026
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:44,044
I-I am sorry.

1027
01:02:44,178 --> 01:02:45,679
So weird.

1028
01:02:45,812 --> 01:02:46,981
I'm sorry!

1029
01:02:47,114 --> 01:02:48,324
I don't know why you're shouting at me.

1030
01:02:48,348 --> 01:02:49,628
Well, 'cause... Okay, well, fine.

1031
01:02:49,716 --> 01:02:51,986
I was a... I was a loser before I met you.

1032
01:02:52,119 --> 01:02:53,753
Yep. That's right. And, uh...

1033
01:02:53,887 --> 01:02:55,655
And now I am someone.

1034
01:02:57,557 --> 01:03:00,027
All right? You made me special.

1035
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:01,261
Damn right.

1036
01:03:01,395 --> 01:03:02,675
Why don't you put a cherry on it?

1037
01:03:02,762 --> 01:03:05,632
A cherry on that? Right. Um...

1038
01:03:05,765 --> 01:03:07,434
I'm...

1039
01:03:07,567 --> 01:03:10,370
I-I am truly very sorry for everything that I said.

1040
01:03:10,504 --> 01:03:12,372
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Everything that I did not say.

1041
01:03:12,506 --> 01:03:14,074
Everything that I did, you know. Mm-hmm.

1042
01:03:14,208 --> 01:03:15,718
And probably everything that I-I did...

1043
01:03:15,742 --> 01:03:16,977
I did not... I did not do.

1044
01:03:17,111 --> 01:03:18,812
Mm... yeah, he's thinking.

1045
01:03:18,945 --> 01:03:21,982
Hmm... come on. Come on.

1046
01:03:23,783 --> 01:03:25,385
Okay. Whoa.

1047
01:03:25,519 --> 01:03:27,387
Whoa! Oh.

1048
01:03:27,521 --> 01:03:28,388
Oh, no.

1049
01:03:28,522 --> 01:03:30,024
Kiss her.

1050
01:03:30,157 --> 01:03:31,837
Are you gonna... Are you gonna kiss me now?

1051
01:03:31,925 --> 01:03:33,393
No. No?

1052
01:03:33,527 --> 01:03:35,162
Oh, god, I'm never doing that again.

1053
01:03:35,295 --> 01:03:36,763
God, well, maybe never. I don't know.

1054
01:03:36,896 --> 01:03:37,998
Honestly, it's really fun.

1055
01:03:38,132 --> 01:03:39,599
If we save the day,

1056
01:03:39,733 --> 01:03:41,211
can we call ourselves the lethal protector?

1057
01:03:41,235 --> 01:03:43,103
That is so '80s. Dan, pack quickly.

1058
01:03:43,237 --> 01:03:45,605
Don't stay. And if for any reason...

1059
01:03:45,739 --> 01:03:46,940
Fire and sound.

1060
01:03:47,074 --> 01:03:48,575
"Fire and sound"? Is that a band?

1061
01:03:48,708 --> 01:03:50,377
No, it's what kills them. Yeah.

1062
01:03:50,510 --> 01:03:52,412
Okay, look, man, I've got her.

1063
01:03:55,382 --> 01:03:56,916
Not sorry.

1064
01:03:57,051 --> 01:03:58,818
Oh... god, I'm so sorry.

1065
01:03:58,952 --> 01:04:01,221
Man, those two need some serious couples counseling.

1066
01:04:05,325 --> 01:04:08,095
I'm pulling up to Brock's now.

1067
01:04:12,166 --> 01:04:14,201
Shit. Oh, my god.

1068
01:04:16,336 --> 01:04:19,439
Kasady, place your hands on your head!

1069
01:04:20,540 --> 01:04:22,476
Which, um...

1070
01:04:22,609 --> 01:04:24,578
Hands?

1071
01:04:24,711 --> 01:04:26,146
What the...

1072
01:04:30,817 --> 01:04:32,852
We found you.

1073
01:04:32,986 --> 01:04:36,090
Shriek will be so pleased.

1074
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:42,562
Yoo-hoo!

1075
01:04:43,897 --> 01:04:45,932
Brockalicious.

1076
01:05:01,181 --> 01:05:03,783
Bling-a-ling.

1077
01:05:05,585 --> 01:05:08,688
Now, whose finger were you meant for?

1078
01:05:12,859 --> 01:05:14,728
Ah.

1079
01:05:14,861 --> 01:05:17,697
A nice, shiny lure

1080
01:05:17,831 --> 01:05:20,300
for a little fishy.

1081
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:29,743
Okay. Here we go, buddy.

1082
01:05:38,218 --> 01:05:40,154
Hello, Anne.

1083
01:05:40,287 --> 01:05:42,822
I just incapacitated your boyfriend.

1084
01:05:42,956 --> 01:05:44,491
Now, he'll be okay...

1085
01:05:44,624 --> 01:05:47,026
With an answer about where Eddie Brock is.

1086
01:05:47,161 --> 01:05:50,830
Well, I'm sure as shit not gonna tell you that.

1087
01:05:50,964 --> 01:05:52,766
It's a shame to hurt you.

1088
01:05:59,373 --> 01:06:03,177
Tell Brock cletus will make a swap.

1089
01:06:03,310 --> 01:06:05,779
Her head for his.

1090
01:06:07,347 --> 01:06:09,149
He's gonna kill you both.

1091
01:06:09,283 --> 01:06:11,618
Peeps have tried that already.

1092
01:06:11,751 --> 01:06:13,753
Botched it.

1093
01:06:25,465 --> 01:06:27,334
They can't find him!

1094
01:06:27,467 --> 01:06:29,336
They are hunting us, too, buddy.

1095
01:06:31,271 --> 01:06:33,139
Come on, where are you?

1096
01:06:38,512 --> 01:06:40,380
Hey, Dan. What's going on?

1097
01:06:40,514 --> 01:06:42,516
Eddie, they got her. Huh?

1098
01:06:42,649 --> 01:06:44,451
They've taken Anne! Calm down.

1099
01:06:44,584 --> 01:06:45,861
Yeah, they took her to their wedding.

1100
01:06:45,885 --> 01:06:47,521
They took her where? Their wedding.

1101
01:06:47,654 --> 01:06:49,523
Grace cathedral. Hurry. We're on our way.

1102
01:06:49,656 --> 01:06:52,459
All right, it looks like we are going to a wedding.

1103
01:06:52,592 --> 01:06:54,661
Oh, will there be canapés?

1104
01:06:54,794 --> 01:06:56,330
You bet your ass.

1105
01:07:32,466 --> 01:07:35,869
That distant cathedral

1106
01:07:36,002 --> 01:07:38,372
is all I see.

1107
01:07:40,340 --> 01:07:44,210
Fractured angel,

1108
01:07:44,344 --> 01:07:46,346
the other part of me.

1109
01:07:48,415 --> 01:07:50,116
D-Dearly beloved...

1110
01:07:50,250 --> 01:07:51,951
Gifts first.

1111
01:07:52,085 --> 01:07:53,887
Actually, traditionally...

1112
01:07:54,020 --> 01:07:56,222
Shut your mouth.

1113
01:07:58,057 --> 01:07:59,192
Father.

1114
01:07:59,326 --> 01:08:03,463
Baby, I got for you what you want most.

1115
01:08:03,597 --> 01:08:05,064
The cop?

1116
01:08:05,198 --> 01:08:06,733
The cop.

1117
01:08:06,866 --> 01:08:08,134
Continue, father.

1118
01:08:08,268 --> 01:08:12,238
Dearly beloved, if anyone objects to this marriage,

1119
01:08:12,372 --> 01:08:15,074
speak now or forever hold th-their...

1120
01:08:17,544 --> 01:08:18,978
Where is she?!

1121
01:08:22,316 --> 01:08:24,183
There you are.

1122
01:08:24,318 --> 01:08:26,185
Death to you, father.

1123
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:27,186
No!

1124
01:08:27,321 --> 01:08:29,022
Not you, father.

1125
01:08:29,155 --> 01:08:31,725
You, father.

1126
01:08:31,858 --> 01:08:33,960
Oh, shit!

1127
01:08:34,093 --> 01:08:35,762
Uh, where you going? What are you doing?

1128
01:08:35,895 --> 01:08:37,497
This is much worse than I thought.

1129
01:08:37,631 --> 01:08:39,966
That is a red one. Wow. Uh...

1130
01:08:40,099 --> 01:08:42,369
Red one? We should leave immediately.

1131
01:08:42,502 --> 01:08:44,003
Annie will get over it.

1132
01:08:44,137 --> 01:08:46,573
We never liked her anyway. So let's go.

1133
01:08:46,706 --> 01:08:47,841
Now?

1134
01:08:47,974 --> 01:08:49,118
Congratulations to the happy couple.

1135
01:08:49,142 --> 01:08:50,276
We are leaving.

1136
01:08:50,410 --> 01:08:52,211
Eddie! Yoo-hoo.

1137
01:08:52,346 --> 01:08:54,781
I'll be right with you, all right? Mm.

1138
01:08:54,914 --> 01:08:56,783
Okay, you need to come out right now.

1139
01:08:56,916 --> 01:08:59,786
Because I am feeling super, super vulnerable right here.

1140
01:08:59,919 --> 01:09:01,421
Brock's just like you?

1141
01:09:01,555 --> 01:09:02,922
Not for long.

1142
01:09:04,358 --> 01:09:06,960
Eddie, over here!

1143
01:09:07,093 --> 01:09:08,795
You need to come out right now.

1144
01:09:08,928 --> 01:09:11,665
I will let you eat everybody. You can eat 'em all!

1145
01:09:11,798 --> 01:09:14,534
Apart from him in the robe. You cannot eat him.

1146
01:09:14,668 --> 01:09:16,603
Promise? I promise.

1147
01:09:19,406 --> 01:09:20,907
Thank you.

1148
01:09:34,921 --> 01:09:36,723
Baby!

1149
01:09:36,856 --> 01:09:38,692
Shut your mouth.

1150
01:09:39,793 --> 01:09:41,961
Marriage trouble already?

1151
01:09:43,963 --> 01:09:45,331
Time to die.

1152
01:09:45,465 --> 01:09:46,866
That's the spirit.

1153
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:50,103
I mean us. We are going to die.

1154
01:10:31,978 --> 01:10:33,513
I-I killed you.

1155
01:10:33,647 --> 01:10:36,416
Well, you can't kill a ghost.

1156
01:10:39,586 --> 01:10:43,990
You, kill him, but keep your mouth shut.

1157
01:10:44,123 --> 01:10:46,960
Our wife knows what she's doing.

1158
01:10:47,093 --> 01:10:48,862
Just turn it down.

1159
01:10:48,995 --> 01:10:51,631
Who do you think you're talking to?

1160
01:10:51,765 --> 01:10:54,668
Stop him. My cop!

1161
01:11:01,307 --> 01:11:02,676
Honeymoon over?

1162
01:11:02,809 --> 01:11:04,744
Oh, god. No.

1163
01:11:07,213 --> 01:11:08,982
Power up.

1164
01:11:09,115 --> 01:11:10,116
No!

1165
01:11:27,033 --> 01:11:29,936
Mayday, mayday, mayday. Cletus kasady...

1166
01:11:41,848 --> 01:11:46,953
What do they say about an eye for an eye?

1167
01:11:56,663 --> 01:11:58,364
Fire and sound.

1168
01:11:58,498 --> 01:11:59,566
Except without the sound.

1169
01:12:03,102 --> 01:12:04,571
Baby!

1170
01:12:07,173 --> 01:12:08,207
Cletus!

1171
01:12:38,304 --> 01:12:40,139
Mano a mano, Brock.

1172
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:49,749
You know how I spent my endless days?

1173
01:12:59,959 --> 01:13:01,661
I spent them thinking about

1174
01:13:01,795 --> 01:13:05,665
how you only told one side of the story.

1175
01:13:18,377 --> 01:13:22,381
You didn't write about the part where cletus was abused

1176
01:13:22,515 --> 01:13:25,619
by mommy, daddy and granny!

1177
01:13:58,952 --> 01:14:03,589
You didn't tell the world how he was a scared little boy

1178
01:14:03,723 --> 01:14:06,259
that no one cared about

1179
01:14:06,392 --> 01:14:09,629
and no one came to save!

1180
01:14:13,499 --> 01:14:17,637
You never asked yourself why!

1181
01:14:17,771 --> 01:14:21,307
That's bad journalism!

1182
01:14:28,247 --> 01:14:30,950
Oh, happy days.

1183
01:14:39,793 --> 01:14:42,662
I'm not a crazy man,

1184
01:14:43,529 --> 01:14:47,100
but I am a vengeful one.

1185
01:14:51,004 --> 01:14:53,372
You're going to watch her die.

1186
01:14:59,545 --> 01:15:02,148
Anne! Anne!

1187
01:15:17,864 --> 01:15:18,864
Do something!

1188
01:15:20,867 --> 01:15:24,470
Eddie, I'm afraid we cannot beat them.

1189
01:15:29,743 --> 01:15:33,212
Baby, that's too much.

1190
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:36,049
You got to stop him.

1191
01:15:36,182 --> 01:15:37,951
What are you doing?

1192
01:15:38,084 --> 01:15:40,153
I'll shut her up for good.

1193
01:15:41,220 --> 01:15:43,890
No, stop! You're hurting her!

1194
01:15:48,494 --> 01:15:49,495
Get up!

1195
01:15:49,628 --> 01:15:51,697
I can't.

1196
01:15:52,732 --> 01:15:54,633
Look. Look.

1197
01:15:54,768 --> 01:15:56,836
They're not symbiotic.

1198
01:15:57,737 --> 01:15:58,737
Get away from her!

1199
01:15:58,838 --> 01:15:59,838
Shut up.

1200
01:15:59,939 --> 01:16:02,108
Get your hands off my wife!

1201
01:16:04,177 --> 01:16:06,379
They're not a match.

1202
01:16:06,512 --> 01:16:07,914
We are.

1203
01:16:08,047 --> 01:16:10,884
That's right. We are.

1204
01:16:12,418 --> 01:16:14,353
Together, we are...

1205
01:16:16,122 --> 01:16:18,357
Venom & the lethal protector!

1206
01:17:35,101 --> 01:17:39,305
Let there be carnage!

1207
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:03,562
I got you. You okay?

1208
01:18:33,426 --> 01:18:36,963
Father, one of us must die.

1209
01:18:37,096 --> 01:18:39,398
We need fire.

1210
01:18:42,735 --> 01:18:45,304
Or sound.

1211
01:18:59,552 --> 01:19:01,520
No!

1212
01:19:18,137 --> 01:19:21,207
Holy mackerel.

1213
01:19:57,876 --> 01:20:00,446
He did not taste good.

1214
01:20:13,126 --> 01:20:14,593
I'm a killer

1215
01:20:14,727 --> 01:20:17,596
with or without the monster, Eddie.

1216
01:20:19,798 --> 01:20:21,600
You know what I really wanted?

1217
01:20:22,901 --> 01:20:24,570
No. What was it, cletus?

1218
01:20:24,703 --> 01:20:27,706
I told you, but you weren't listening.

1219
01:20:28,807 --> 01:20:30,443
Well, I'm listening now.

1220
01:20:31,810 --> 01:20:34,313
I wanted your friendship.

1221
01:20:36,615 --> 01:20:38,651
I'm sorry, cletus.

1222
01:20:41,054 --> 01:20:43,022
Fuck this guy.

1223
01:21:04,743 --> 01:21:06,979
You in there, get him out of here.

1224
01:21:07,113 --> 01:21:08,847
They're gonna come for you both.

1225
01:21:08,981 --> 01:21:10,616
I know.

1226
01:21:12,118 --> 01:21:14,120
Hey, Anne.

1227
01:21:14,253 --> 01:21:16,089
Take care.

1228
01:21:19,425 --> 01:21:21,026
Yeah, you, too, champ.

1229
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:22,661
Dan!

1230
01:21:22,795 --> 01:21:24,363
You take care, too.

1231
01:21:24,497 --> 01:21:25,931
Thanks.

1232
01:21:26,065 --> 01:21:27,500
I like you.

1233
01:21:27,633 --> 01:21:29,335
We totally didn't need him, though.

1234
01:21:29,468 --> 01:21:33,106
Honestly, I think he was more of a hindrance than a help.

1235
01:21:46,785 --> 01:21:48,687
Monsters.

1236
01:21:58,297 --> 01:22:00,099
That there is Don quixote,

1237
01:22:00,233 --> 01:22:03,502
and the guy next to him is, uh, s-Sancho panza.

1238
01:22:03,636 --> 01:22:05,238
They're two very different people

1239
01:22:05,371 --> 01:22:07,940
who have very different takes on the world.

1240
01:22:08,073 --> 01:22:10,643
D-Different ways of doing things.

1241
01:22:10,776 --> 01:22:13,212
Sometimes they didn't like each other a whole lot,

1242
01:22:13,346 --> 01:22:15,781
but ultimately...

1243
01:22:15,914 --> 01:22:19,185
They worked together to bring out the best in each other.

1244
01:22:20,319 --> 01:22:24,089
Eddie, the time has come.

1245
01:22:24,223 --> 01:22:26,292
I must go alone.

1246
01:22:26,425 --> 01:22:28,527
It is me they want.

1247
01:22:28,661 --> 01:22:30,363
Yeah.

1248
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:34,233
Well, my dear Sancho,

1249
01:22:34,367 --> 01:22:37,536
facts are the enemy of truth.

1250
01:22:37,670 --> 01:22:39,638
What does that even mean?

1251
01:22:39,772 --> 01:22:41,607
It means...

1252
01:22:42,608 --> 01:22:46,345
It means that we are...

1253
01:22:46,479 --> 01:22:48,214
Frien... fugitives!

1254
01:22:48,347 --> 01:22:50,483
Um, yeah. Yeah.

1255
01:22:50,616 --> 01:22:52,851
On the run. That, too.

1256
01:23:06,732 --> 01:23:09,435
Thank you for bringing me here.

1257
01:23:09,568 --> 01:23:12,037
Yeah, you're welcome, buddy.

1258
01:23:12,171 --> 01:23:13,972
It's beautiful, huh? Mm-hmm.

1259
01:23:14,106 --> 01:23:17,576
I'm sorry that we can't do anything about the old

1260
01:23:17,710 --> 01:23:20,145
"wind in your hair" situation, but...

1261
01:23:20,279 --> 01:23:23,682
Osho says, when you love someone,

1262
01:23:23,816 --> 01:23:26,619
you accept the whole person... Osho?

1263
01:23:26,752 --> 01:23:29,322
With all of their defects.

1264
01:23:29,455 --> 01:23:30,956
"Defects." hmm.

1265
01:23:31,089 --> 01:23:32,391
Nobody is perfect.

1266
01:23:32,525 --> 01:23:33,892
Just go back. Go back a minute.

1267
01:23:34,026 --> 01:23:36,695
You telling me... You just said that you love me.

1268
01:23:36,829 --> 01:23:38,464
Um... you did.

1269
01:23:40,566 --> 01:23:42,368
Where will we go?

1270
01:23:42,501 --> 01:23:45,371
I don't know. I don't know.

1271
01:23:45,504 --> 01:23:48,140
Anywhere that needs a lethal protector, I suppose.

1272
01:23:48,274 --> 01:23:50,943
Oh! You really meant it!

1273
01:23:51,076 --> 01:23:52,511
Yeah.

1274
01:23:52,645 --> 01:23:55,281
We will need a cape and a mask.

1275
01:23:56,615 --> 01:23:57,716
No.

1276
01:23:57,850 --> 01:23:59,818
No, I think you got that covered. We're good.
